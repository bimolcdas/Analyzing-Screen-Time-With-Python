# Project Overview: Analyzing User Screen Time Patterns and Notification Influence on App Engagement

This project delves into user screen time data to uncover engagement patterns and examine the role of notifications in driving app usage. Our primary objective is to assess how notifications prompt app openings and influence overall screen time, providing actionable insights for users aiming to better manage their app interactions.

Dataset Overview:

The dataset includes key metrics across popular apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, Netflix, LinkedIn, and X (formerly Twitter), as well as less commonly used apps like 8 Ball Pool and Safari. Main variables include:
	•	Date: The recording day of data.
	•	App: The app being analyzed (e.g., Instagram, WhatsApp).
	•	Usage (minutes): Total daily screen time per app.
	•	Notifications: Number of notifications received daily per app.
	•	Times Opened: Frequency of daily app openings.

Key Insights:

Analysis reveals distinct daily screen time trends, with peak usage on Mondays and Wednesdays and lower engagement towards week’s end. Instagram stands out with consistently high screen time and frequent notifications, while Netflix users show long, uninterrupted sessions with minimal openings, reflective of binge-watching behavior.

A significant finding is the probability of opening an app upon receiving a notification, which remains at a consistent 1.0 across all apps. This indicates notifications are highly effective in prompting app openings, making them a powerful driver of engagement.

Conclusion:

This study highlights notifications as a major contributor to screen time across apps. For users looking to reduce app usage, turning off notifications could be an impactful first step. By offering a clear picture of daily engagement patterns and notification-driven behaviors, this project provides valuable insights into fostering healthier digital habits and effective screen time management.
